<p>This code can solve the first four puzzles.  Please see the files solve1.txt, solve2.txt, etc. in the
topmost directory (./sudTest).  These files were generated by cut and pasting from the console on Chrome. I went off script a bit when I was told to do this in the frontend framework Ember, and so I did not do file i/o, but instead built a resizeable Sudoku gameboard, and went down a bit of a rabbit hole playing with Ember and trying to get a reactive data model going, but did not hit paydirt on that. So what would have gone on backend code ended up being wedged into the ugga.js route file which returns the model, and I know that is wrong.  I am guessing the answer is in controllers, not components.  I would love to see how it is supposed to be done!
